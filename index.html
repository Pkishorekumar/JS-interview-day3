    <h1>What is the use of setTimeout</h1>
    <pre>
        The setTimeout() is a method inside the window object, it calls the specified function or
        evaluates a JavaScript expression provided as a string after a given time period for only once.
        We all have used alarms or reminders several times, this setTimeout() method also has the
        same purpose in web applications. 
    </pre>
    <h1>What is an event loop and call stack</h1>
    <pre>
        A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser)
        to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently
        being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. or we can say that it
        stores global execution context and function execution context. 
    </pre>
    <h1>What are promises and why do we need them?</h1>
    <pre>
        Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage
        when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell
        leading to unmanageable code.
        Multiple callback functions would create callback hell that leads to unmanageable code. Also it
        is not easy for any user to handle multiple callbacks at the same time.   
    </pre>
    <h1>What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h1>
    <pre>
        An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is
        permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based
        behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need promise chains.
        The use of await pauses the async function until the promise returns a result (resolve or reject)
        value.   
    </pre>
    <h1>What is hoisting?</h1>
    <pre>
        Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
        top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations,
        not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting. Let and const keywords are
        not hoisted so when you try to access them before initialization they start giving you Reference
        error. 
    </pre>
    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
    <pre>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the
        structure and content of a document on the web.
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It
        represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
        The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
        interact with the page.
    </pre>
    <h1>Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h1>
    <pre>
        Undefined
        undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns undefined
        to any variable that has been declared but not initialized. In other words, in a case where no
        value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined.
        
        null
        It is one of JavaScript's primitive data type and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.null is
        an empty or non-existent value and null must be assigned. We use null when we want to
        explicitly declare that a variable is empty.
        
        not defined
        A not defined is a variable that is not declared inside the code at a given point of time with
        declaration keyword like var, let, or const.
